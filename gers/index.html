<div>hi! i'm xiaowei wang, and i'm a designer and cartographer at mapbox</div>
<div>i've done a lot of projects involving mapping of different kinds...</div>

<div><img src="images/float.jpg">
including some air quality mapping with kites, during a time where air quality data was censored in china
</div>

<div>Today we'll be talking about the role of the designer as <em>educator</em> and <em>facilitator</em>, and design projects <em>in developing countries.</em></div>

<div>Takeaways:
<ul>
<li>+project/product sustainability can have bigger impact than the product itself </li>
<li>+the co-design process can start in the design research phase as a way to teach <em>data literacy</em></li>
<li>+data visualization and design are <em>intertwined</em></li>
<li>+surveys are not just a way of gathering data on your end user, but it's a way to really get users excited and feel invested in the project</li>
<li>+as part of project sustainability, we need local projects that don't scale <em>as much</em> as big projects that do</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
  first: an exercise
</div>

<div>
  using trace paper and a piece of white paper, map one phenomenon -- ie light, sound volume, shadows. <em>try not to</em> use a bird's eye view. let's use 5 minutes.
</div>

<div>
  some examples from previous version of this exercise
</div>

<div>

<div>
<img src="images/example2.png">
</div>

<div>
  data visualization is hard(!) and the process of visualizing data is a form of design research.
</div>

<div>
  that's great, but how does it become a design project? how does it become a way to teach people data literacy and design skills?<em>and why is it important?</em>
</div>

<div>
  specifically, geographic data is key in the way we shape the environment around us, and knowing how to create, read and visualize geographic data is an often overlooked but </em>crucial skill</em>
</div>

<div>
  <img src="images/poi.png">
  where do you go? how are you influenced?
</div>

<div>
  it's <em>economic, it's environmental</em>, it can shape policy. designing for projects and products that work with geographic data is as much thinking about data tools as it is building an ecosystem of engagement and learning.

<div>
  what's striking about these examples is a technological barrier to entry, and how they require not only access to technology, but data literacy, understanding data visualizations, and technical skills

  knowledge gap hypothesis: "The knowledge gap hypothesis does not suggest that the lower-SES population segments remain completely uninformed, but that the growth of knowledge is relatively greater among the higher-SES population segments."

  all of these stumbling blocks were present in the project I was part of in Mongolia

  in a country of 5,077 NGOs (and a population of 2.84 million)
</div>



<div>
  we wanted to work in the ger districts, helping people learn the skills for mapping their own yards, to create documentation for when they wanted to register their parcels, but also to foster more informed grassroots design.
</div>

<div>
  there were other great projects like Asia Foundation's work with <em>Open Street Map</em> to help UB's government map ger districts for city planning purposes

  we knew our work would be to <em>]bridge the gap[</em> between what the government and NGOs were doing with data, and what citizen groups could do with data and taking design into their own hands. what kind of data do we need for this?

  surveys: getting people engaged
</div>

<div><img src="images/nmc-members-bowl.jpg">
  instead of having a poll or anonymous survey taker, train embedded people in the community

<div>

<div><img src="images/colors.png"
  <ul>
    <li>be specific in at least half of your survey - asking vague, or open ended questions can be intimidating for people who think you expect a so-called correct answer</li>
    <li>but do offer space for people who want to go one step further</li>
    <li>have survey takers be embedded within the community - so that these questions are not coming from an outsider but from community members</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>who represents the tone of the project, going into it?</li>
    <li>what baseline design ideas do you need to question -- color? shapes? understandings of privacy?</li>
    <li>what can you give back, in non monetary, non material ways?</li>
  </ul>

<div>
  volunteers learned about collecting data, because it was their first time, they shared what they were doing openly and transparently with the surveyees.
</div>

<div>
 in 213 surveys, 70% of people mentioned that they were excited to have such a transparent process -- <em>usually NGOs come in, take information, and they had no clue where the information they gave was going to</em>
</div>

<div>
  and of course, we found all kinds of surprises about what format our documentation and maps of each household's land plot should take - from colors, to access to digital maps, to how directions were understood or given.
</div>

<div>
  "People are not used to maps," Rahul explains. Giving directions in India is an idiomatic art, well-rehearsed and rarely done following formal strictures. He goes on: "I can guarantee you nobody will say, 'head south.'" Rather than cardinal directions, people will navigate the lost using a series of routes and familiar landmarks.
