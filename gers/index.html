<div>hi! i'm xiaowei wang, and i'm a designer and cartographer at mapbox</div>
<div>i've done a lot of projects involving mapping of different kinds...</div>
<div> </div>

<div>Today we'll be talking about the role of the designer as <em>educator</em> and <em>facilitator</em>, and design projects <em>in developing countries.</em></div>

<div>Takeaways:
<ul>
<li>project/product sustainability can have bigger impact than the product itself </li>
<li>the co-design process can start in the design research phase as a way to teach <em>data literacy</em></li>
<li>data visualization and design are intertwined</li>
<li>surveys are not just a way of gathering data on your end user, but it's a way to really get users excited</li>
<li>as part of project sustainability, we need local projects that don't scale up as much as big ones that do</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
  first: an exercise
</div>

<div>
  using trace paper and a piece of white paper, map one phenomenon -- ie light, sound volume, shadows. <em>try not to</em> use a bird's eye view. let's use 5 minutes.
</div>

<div>
  some examples from previous version of this exercise
</div>

<div>
  empty
</div>

<div>
  data visualization is hard, and the process of visualizing data is a form of research.
</div>

<div>
  that's great, but how does it become a design project? how does it become a way to teach people data literacy and design skills?<em>and why is it important?</em>
</div>

<div>
  geographic data is key in the way we shape the environment around us, and knowing how to create, read and visualize geographic data is an often overlooked but crucial skill</em>
</div>

<div>
  it's economic, it's environmental, it can shape policy. designing for projects and products that work with geographic data is as much thinking about data tools as it is building an ecosystem of engagement and learning.
</div>

<div>
  public lab example
</div>

<div>
  lagos example
</div>

<div>
  vineet's work
</div>

<div>
  what's striking about these examples is a technological barrier to entry, and how they require not only access to technology, but data literacy, understanding data visualizations, and technical skills
</div>

  knowledge gap hypothesis: "The knowledge gap hypothesis does not suggest that the lower-SES population segments remain completely uninformed, but that the growth of knowledge is relatively greater among the higher-SES population segments."

<div>
  all of these stumbling blocks were present in the project I was part of in Mongolia...
</div>

<div>
  <em>the nomadic mapping collective</em>, sponsored by the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and ZERO1
</div>

<div>
  took place in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's ger districts

    <li>a chance to produce documentation as a product -- a designed object that would serve as legal evidence of inhabiting a piece of land (similar to lagos project)</li>
    <li>in making this product, a chance to research and educate end users about data literacy</li>
