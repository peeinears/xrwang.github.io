<p>Judgement is card of contemplation and passage, not a final decision or an institutional judgement.</p>

<p>While institutional, decision making judgement is of the visceral, earthly realm, the card Judgement calls for higher contemplation and reaching for knowledge beyond ourselves. It reminds us to shed old ways of thinking and hear a call of liberation. In the traditional Rider-Waite deck, mountains in the distance remind us of wisdom beyond the immediate environment. They are "mountains of abstract thought". This triangular shape is symbolic of parents and a child, a triad of strength. The third point in the triangle, the child, can not fully understand or know herself until she gives herself to a higher faith or a higher call - belief manifests self realization. </p>

<p>Why the higher call? Judgement reminds us that there is no personal liberation -- only through communal liberation can we liberate ourselves, because we are the offspring of our environments and all that comes to shape us. As the 20th card of the Rider-Waite tarot (the Wheel of Fortune's card number multiplied by two), Judgement is a reminder of two kinds of time meeting on earth -- of the eternal, universal time, and the time we encounter every day.</p>

<p>Judgement: What are the new realizations to incorporate into our lives? What old acts will we preserve, and how will we carry them out in new ways, with new perspectives? What can we give to each other, and how can we share our blessings in our journey to further ourselves?</p>
